# Submission Flowchart

{{< figure src="/submission_pipeline.png" imgclass="img-fluid" >}}


1.	Submissions to the oral presentation track will be evaluated by the paper evaluation committee. Based on the results, it will be presented either in Track A, which has both oral and poster presentations, or in Track B, which is jointly presented with Track C as a poster presentation in an interactive session. The camera ready deadline for all tracks is 6/22. 

2. If you submit to the oral presentation track and want the paper to be considered for the IEICE journal, please submit it through the IEICE website to the journal track. The evaluation process is the same as for MIRU2026. If it is judged as suitable for journal publication, it can be published in a cooperated IEICE journal (Letter). Note, that the review guidelines for MIRU2026 and IEICE Journals do not match, so they might yield different outcomes. In this case, authors are responsible for publication fees.

3.	For poster track submissions without paper evaluations, please submit to Track C. You will be able to present your work as a poster in an interactive session. The submission deadline is 6/22. 

4.	In case you need a larger setup than a poster plus a laptop or tablet (e.g., cameras, sensors, VR setups, etc.), please submit your paper to the Track D as a demo presentation. For demo presentations, in addition to a poster panel, you can receive a desk and power supply. The submission deadline is 6/22.


# Style Guidelines

- Write your manuscript in Japanese or English. 
- Keep it within 4 pages without references.
- Include an abstract (up to 100 words in English or 200 characters in Japanese) on the first page.
- Include author names and their affiliations in the manuscript. The paper evaluations for the oral presentation track are single-blinded, meaning that evaluators will be able to see the author list.
- The authors may optionally submit supplementary materials such as videos, proofs, code, additional figures or tables, or more detailed analysis of experiments presented in the paper. Reviewers will be encouraged to look at it, but are not obligated to do so.


## Template

Use the template provided below. It changed since last year, so make sure to download the newest version. Both LaTeX and Word support Japanese and English.

- Word Template ([ZIP](https://drive.google.com/uc?id=1H-1j7PFAwhMqlVpFnPFe6XHkwQWbGe6s&export=download))

## Miscellaneous

- The copyright of submitted manuscripts will be retained with the author(s). The MIRU Extended Abstracts will only be made available to MIRU participants during the event via a password-protected download link on the website. 
- You cannot make any changes to the title or author list after the camera ready deadline.

* For example, if your paper is <span style="color: red;">accepted</span> by CVPR2026 in February, then you are not allowed to submit it to the MIRU2026 Oral Presentation Track. 

(The points below are regarding oral presentation track submissions.)

- As MIRU is a forum to exchange of "new ideas" that do not reach the level for journal or international conference submission yet, please refrain from submitting work which is already published in a peer-reviewed journal or conference proceedings. 
- The MIRU2026 Extended Abstracts will not be made publicly available. However, if you use parts of a paper, which are submitted to international conferences or journals, make sure to still comply with their submission guidelines. 

【For reference】In CVPR2026, submissions that are no more than 4 pages (excluding references) do not count as dual submissions.
